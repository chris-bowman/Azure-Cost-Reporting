# Azure Cost Management Power BI Report

This report has been developed over a number of years as a starting point for building Azure Cost reporting using the [Azure Cost Management Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-cost-management). This is something I have created in my spare time to help customers visualise Azure costs.

> **Note: Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) Billing Account / Billing Profile support has been recently added. Please log an issue if there are any problems with it**

## Version Info

As this report is provided as a sample, support is limited to the latest version. [Link to changes](CHANGELOG.md).

## Report Pages

- **Summary Tab**: This page shows an overview of enrolment costs, by month and subscription, as well as a daily trend. Costs are further broken down by resource group. Across the top are the totals for the selected time period (with exception for the last 30 days cost). Details can be found in subsequent pages.

- **New Deployments Tab**: This shows deployments made in the past month (Resource IDs not seen in the past 30 days) to help understand what is new in your environment.

- **Marketplace Usage Tab**: This shows any recent Azure Marketplace usage.

- **Cost Allocations Tab**: This page shows an overview of costs, by specific tags, as well as top 10.

- **Hybrid Benefit Tabs**: This tab aims to show approximate utilisation of [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit ). It introduces a metric 'AHBCores' which represents the number of cores of Windows Server license + SA  will be required to cover a VM on Azure (a minimum of 8 cores - so 1, 2 and 4 core VMs will require 8). <br><br>As the granularity of the data is daily, the number of cores here are approximate - it is assumed if a VM ran using AHB during the day, then it will count for the whole day.

- **Reserved Instances Tab**: This tab shows any Reservations purchased recently, and their approximate utilisation. For more accurate utilisation numbers, refer to the Azure Portal Reservations blade. <br><br>It also shows reserved instances recommendations based on the RI Recommendations API. They are based off the past 30 days usage, and 1-year RI terms are shown (to reveal 3-year RI terms, change the visualisation filters).

- **Non-Prod 24x7 VMs Tab**: This tab shows VMs that have been running >700 hours in the past 30 days, from non production subscriptions.

- **Logging Tab**: This shows Azure Monitor trends over the past 30 days.

- **Storage Tab**: This tab shows actual costs for storage over the past 30 days, and shows an approximate trend for total storage capacity (this is based off actual paid & provisioned storage usage, in storage accounts, CosmosDB, Backup, etc).

- **Network Tab**: This tab shows actual costs for network over the past 30 days, and shows an approximate trend for total bandwidth in/out.

- **Compute Tab**: This tab shows compute trends over the past 30 days.

- **Price Sheet Tab**: This tab shows your enrollment price sheet for available subscription offers.

## Data Model

Most of the tables in the Power BI connector are included, although to reduce data size, some large text columns have been excluded (these can be seen in the Power Query Editor).
Two static tables have been added for VM size and Managed Disk capacity (future scope to move these to API calls to auto-refresh).

In order to introduce support for MCA customers, some columns have been renamed to match EA tables as the data model is different between EA and MCA.

> **Note: In the table Subscriptions, there is a grouping column "SubscriptionGroup". You can modify these groups to group related subscriptions together and report based on this.**
